#4-1 Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these
#pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of 
#each pizza
#	-Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name os the
#	pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each 
#	pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple 
#	statement like 'I like pepperoni pizza.'
#	-Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that
#	consist of the three or more lines about  the kinds of pizza you 
#	like and then an additonal sentence, such as 'I really love pizza!'
