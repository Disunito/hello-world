#Marshall 4/14/20 Testing Lists and how they work. Including
#functions and .title() method. I was testing how the index
#worked for lists as well.

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles)
print(bicycles[0])
print(bicycles[0].title())
print(bicycles[-4].title())

message = f'\nMy last bike was a {bicycles[3].title()}'
print(message)
